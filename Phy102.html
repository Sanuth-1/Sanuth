            <h2>I. Introduction to PHY 102 General Physics II (Unilag)</h2>
            <p class="italic text-neutral-700">This section introduces PHY 102, outlining its official designation, its place within the Unilag physics curriculum, and its relationship with the prerequisite course, PHY 101. It sets the stage for understanding the course's objectives and its role in a student's physics education journey.</p>

            <h3>Course Description and Context within the Unilag Curriculum</h3>
            <p>PHY 102, officially designated as "Electricity, Magnetism and Modern Physics," is a fundamental second-semester course within the University of Lagos (Unilag) curriculum.[1] This course is strategically positioned to advance students' understanding of physics beyond the introductory concepts covered in PHY 101. As a 3-unit course typically undertaken in the second semester, it logically follows PHY 101, which introduces "Elementary Mechanics, Heat and Properties of Matter".[1] This sequential arrangement is a common practice in university physics programs globally, ensuring a coherent and progressive learning trajectory for students.</p>
            <p>The design of PHY 102 is to build directly upon the foundational principles established in PHY 101, guiding students into the intricate domains of electromagnetic phenomena, the fundamental nature of light, and the revolutionary concepts that define modern physics.[2, 3] This progression is essential for cultivating a holistic and interconnected understanding of the physical world. The consistent naming and topic allocation for PHY 101 (Mechanics/Heat) and PHY 102 (Electricity/Magnetism/Modern Physics) across Unilag and other institutions suggests a widely accepted pedagogical standard for introductory physics sequences. This alignment indicates that Unilag's PHY 102 is an integral component of a coherent, internationally recognized physics curriculum. The topics are strategically sequenced, with the more abstract and field-based concepts of PHY 102 logically following the tangible, force-based concepts of PHY 101. This strong alignment implies that students are expected to possess a solid grasp of PHY 101 principles—such as vector analysis, energy conservation, and basic forces—as a prerequisite for success in PHY 102. Furthermore, the course prepares students for subsequent specialization in physics or allied engineering and science disciplines that heavily rely on electromagnetic theory and modern physics principles.</p>

            <h3>Relationship and Progression from PHY 101 General Physics I</h3>
            <p>PHY 102 functions as a direct continuation of PHY 101, expanding the student's conceptual framework from classical mechanics and thermal physics to encompass the realms of electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics.[2, 3] This continuity is crucial for students to develop a comprehensive and integrated understanding of physics. A significant objective of PHY 102 is to equip students with the capacity for critical thinking and the ability to apply appropriate physics concepts to qualitatively analyze problems and situations.[2] This emphasis extends beyond mere quantitative calculations, prioritizing a deeper conceptual understanding.</p>
            <p>The explicit designation of PHY 102 as a "continuation" course, coupled with learning objectives that stress critical thinking and qualitative analysis using "appropriate concepts," underscores the cumulative nature of physics education.[2, 3] The transition from the macroscopic world of mechanics to the often invisible forces and fields of electromagnetism, and subsequently to the abstract nature of quantum physics, necessitates a robust conceptual foundation. The analytical and problem-solving skills refined in PHY 101, including vector analysis, conservation laws, and energy principles, are directly transferable and indispensable for navigating the complexities of PHY 102. This highlights that students who have not adequately mastered the foundational concepts and problem-solving methodologies from PHY 101 are likely to face significant challenges in PHY 102. The course implicitly demands that students not only recall factual information but also apply a structured approach to problem-solving, a meta-skill that is critically important across all scientific disciplines.</p>

            <h3>A. Electricity and Magnetism</h3>
            <p>This foundational block constitutes the largest segment of the course, progressing from static charges to dynamic fields and their practical applications.</p>
            <h4>Electrostatics</h4>
            <p>The course initiates with fundamental concepts such as electric charges, distinguishing between positive and negative types, and quantitatively describing their interactions through Coulomb's Law. Students are introduced to the concept of the electric field, with electric field lines serving as visual representations, and classic experimental demonstrations like Faraday's ice pail experiments and the gold leaf electroscope are discussed. The curriculum then delves into electric potential energy and potential difference, the abstract concept of electric potential arising from point charges and charge distributions, equipotential lines and surfaces, and the electron volt as a unit of energy. A detailed study of capacitors and capacitance follows, including the crucial role of dielectrics, analysis of series and parallel combinations of capacitors, and calculations of energy stored within them. Electrostatic generators are also mentioned as a practical application.</p>
            <h4>Current Electricity (DC Circuits)</h4>
            <p>Building upon electrostatics, this section defines electric current, current density, and the various sources of electromotive force (emf). Concepts of resistivity and resistance are explored, distinguishing between linear and non-linear circuit elements, and students learn about energy and power dissipation in electric circuits. The course provides a comprehensive analysis of single-loop and multi-loop circuits, detailing series and parallel resistor configurations, and emphasizing the critical application of Kirchhoff's laws for systematic circuit analysis. Measurement techniques for resistance, including the Wheatstone bridge circuit, and the transient behavior of R-C circuits, are also covered.</p>
            <h4>Magnetism</h4>
            <p>The study of magnetism begins with an introduction to magnetic phenomena, magnetic flux, and the fundamental force exerted on moving charges within a magnetic field. The curriculum examines the magnetic force on current-carrying wires and the magnetic torque experienced by current loops. Students gain an understanding of magnetic fields produced by electric currents, applying principles such as the Biot-Savart law and Ampere's law, with specific applications to solenoids and toroids. The properties of various magnetic materials are also discussed, and the galvanometer is introduced as a practical application of magnetic principles.</p>
            <h4>Electromagnetic Induction</h4>
            <p>Key principles in this segment include Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which describes how changing magnetic fields induce electromotive forces, and Lenz's Rule, which provides the direction of these induced currents. Concepts of motional EMF, inductors, and the operational principles of electric generators and transformers are explored, illustrating the practical implications of electromagnetic induction.</p>
            <h4>Alternating Current (AC) Circuits</h4>
            <p>The course provides a basic understanding of alternating current (AC) circuits, introducing concepts such as impedance and reactance. It includes an analysis of the behavior of resistors, capacitors, and inductors when connected to an AC source, both individually and in series combinations.</p>
            <p>The progression of topics from static charges to moving charges, then to magnetic fields generated by currents, and finally to induced currents caused by changing magnetic fields and AC circuits, mirrors the historical development of electromagnetism. This logical sequence culminates in Maxwell's equations, which are explicitly mentioned as unifying electricity and magnetism into a single fundamental force. Each sub-topic builds upon the previous, demonstrating a causal relationship where electric phenomena can induce magnetic ones, and vice-versa. The curriculum is meticulously designed to illustrate the profound unity of electricity and magnetism. Students are guided to understand not just isolated concepts but the dynamic interplay and interdependence between them. This holistic understanding of electromagnetism is a cornerstone of classical physics and is absolutely critical for further studies in advanced physics, electrical engineering, and related fields. It moves students beyond disparate phenomena to a unified field theory.</p>

            <h3>B. Optics</h3>
            <p>This section delves into the behavior of light, exploring both its ray and wave characteristics.</p>
            <h4>Geometric Optics</h4>
            <p>This segment covers the ray model of light, detailing reflection of light on plane and curved surfaces (mirrors), the laws governing reflection, and the principles of image formation. It includes refraction of light through plane and curved surfaces (lenses), the laws of refraction, the concept of refractive index, Snell's Law, critical angle and total internal reflection, and refraction through prisms. A detailed study of image formation through lenses, the lens formula, graphical constructions, combination of lenses, and the concept of lens power is also provided. Practical applications like optical instruments (e.g., microscopes, telescopes) and the correction of common vision defects are integrated into the curriculum.</p>
            <h4>Wave Properties of Light (Physical Optics)</h4>
            <p>This part introduces the wave nature of light, including Huygens' principle, which explains wave propagation. It explores detailed phenomena of interference, such as Young's double-slit experiment, thin wedge interference, and Newton's rings, alongside diffraction phenomena like single slit diffraction, diffraction gratings, and resolving power. The dispersion of light (e.g., white light spectrum, dispersive power, Fraunhofer lines) and the polarization of light (e.g., polarized light, reflection, Brewster's angle) are also comprehensively covered.</p>
            <p>The systematic division of optics into "Geometric Optics" and "Wave Properties of Light" reflects the historical evolution of scientific understanding of light. Geometric optics, which treats light as rays, is sufficient for explaining phenomena like reflection and refraction at macroscopic scales. However, to explain interference and diffraction, a wave model is indispensable. This structured approach implicitly teaches students about the utility of different scientific models and their respective domains of applicability. It lays the groundwork for the later introduction of quantum mechanics, where light is understood to exhibit a wave-particle duality. This systematic progression ensures a comprehensive understanding of light's multifaceted nature, preparing students for the complexities of modern physics.</p>

            <h3>C. Modern Physics</h3>
            <p>This section introduces the revolutionary concepts that reshaped physics in the 20th century, moving beyond the classical framework.</p>
            <h4>Relativity</h4>

Discussions often incorporate thought experiments like the twin paradox and the profound mass-energy relation (E=mc²).</p>
            <h4>Quantum Theory</h4>
            <p>This segment covers the quantization of radiation, particularly Planck's quantum hypothesis, and the photoelectric effect, which compellingly demonstrated the particle-like nature of light. Students are introduced to the concept of wave-particle duality, exemplified by De Broglie's hypothesis for matter waves, and foundational concepts such as Schrödinger's Equation and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.</p>
            <h4>Atomic Physics</h4>
            <p>The study of atomic physics encompasses atomic structure, isotopes, and the operational principles of mass spectrometers. A detailed examination of Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom, the Balmer series, the Rydberg constant, and the significance of quantum numbers in describing electron states is provided. Historical and experimental aspects, including the conduction of electricity through gases, properties of cathode rays, thermionic emission, and basic applications of the diode and triode, are also included. The Millikan oil drop experiment, a cornerstone in determining electron charge, is specifically mentioned.</p>
            <h4>Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity</h4>
            <p>This final part of modern physics focuses on nuclear structure, its constituents (protons and neutrons), and the concept of binding energy. The curriculum covers the properties and characteristics of various types of radioactivity (alpha, beta, gamma decay), the decay law, decay constant, and calculations involving half-life. Discussions extend to the interactions of radiation with matter, different types of detectors for nuclear radiation, and practical applications in medical and industrial fields. Fundamental concepts of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are also covered. The production, properties, and uses of X-rays are included, highlighting their significance in various applications.</p>
            <p>The "Modern Physics" section introduces concepts that fundamentally challenge classical Newtonian physics, including relativity, quantum theory, and atomic/nuclear structure. These topics represent a profound conceptual leap from the deterministic, macroscopic world of classical mechanics and electromagnetism. Relativity redefines space, time, and mass, while quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic behavior and the quantization of energy. This shift signifies a major intellectual revolution in scientific thought, moving beyond easily observable phenomena. The inclusion of these topics in an introductory course ensures students are exposed early to the limitations of classical physics and the revolutionary ideas that shaped 20th-century science and technology. It fosters critical thinking about the very nature of reality and the scientific method, encouraging students to embrace uncertainty and the abstract. This foundational exposure is crucial for any student pursuing science or engineering, as these principles underpin much of modern technology, from lasers to nuclear power.</p>

            <h3>D. Waves and Sound</h3>
            <p>This section addresses general wave phenomena, providing a universal framework applicable to various types of waves, including sound.</p>
            <h4>Wave Motion</h4>
            <p>This segment covers different types of motion, oscillatory motion, and a detailed analysis of simple harmonic motion (SHM), including definitions and examples. It explores the characteristics of wave motion, the classification of waves (e.g., transverse, longitudinal, progressive or travelling, stationary waves), and the mathematical equation of wave motion. Principles of reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction are discussed as they apply to general waves. Concepts of superposition of waves, speed, wavelength, frequency, phase, and energy transfer by waves are also covered. A clear distinction is made between mechanical waves, which require a medium, and electromagnetic waves, which do not.</p>
            <h4>Sound Waves</h4>
            <p>The study of sound waves includes their sources, methods for measuring the speed of sound, and the interference of sound waves. Characteristics of sound such as intensity, pitch, and quality, and the behavior of vibrating strings and air columns are examined. The Doppler effect, which explains changes in perceived frequency due to relative motion, is also covered.</p>
            <p>The syllabus dedicates a section to "Wave motion" and "Sound waves," distinct from "Electromagnetic Waves" and "Optics." This separation allows for the introduction of universal wave properties—such as SHM, superposition, interference, and diffraction—in a general context before applying them to specific types of waves like light or sound. This demonstrates that diverse physical phenomena can be described by common underlying mathematical and conceptual frameworks. This structure reinforces the idea of unifying physical principles in physics. By first teaching general wave properties, the curriculum enables students to recognize common behaviors across different types of waves, fostering a deeper, more transferable understanding of physics beyond just memorizing distinct phenomena. It highlights the power of abstract models and mathematical descriptions that apply broadly across different physical systems.</p>

            <h3>E. Thermodynamics and Properties of Matter (Potential Alternative/Supplementary Topics)</h3>
            <div class="note">
                <h4>Note on Contradiction and Clarification</h4>
                <p>While the primary Unilag PHY 102 syllabus and general "Physics II" curricula consistently focus on Electricity, Magnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics, one specific Unilag Faculty of Engineering course outline lists a different set of topics for PHY 102. These topics predominantly cover concepts typically found in a "Physics I" or "Properties of Matter and Heat" course. Given the strong consensus from multiple, more direct sources for the standard Unilag PHY 102, these topics are presented here as a <em>potential</em> or <em>faculty-specific</em> variation, rather than the core standard PHY 102 content. Students are strongly advised to confirm the specific syllabus for their program of study.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Heat and Temperature</h4>
            <p>This includes concepts of temperature scales (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin), gas laws (e.g., Boyle's, Charles', Gay-Lussac's), the general gas equation, and principles of thermal conductivity.</p>
            <h4>Laws of Thermodynamics</h4>
            <p>This section covers the First Law of Thermodynamics, which relates heat, work, and internal energy, along with concepts of reversibility and thermodynamic processes such as adiabatic, isothermal, and isobaric changes. It also includes the Second Law of Thermodynamics, introducing heat engines and entropy, and the Zero's Law of Thermodynamics.</p>
            <h4>Kinetic Theory of Gases</h4>
            <p>This topic explores the molecular basis of gas properties, including molecular collisions and mean free path.</p>
            <h4>Elasticity</h4>
            <p>This topic covers Hooke’s law, Young’s modulus, Shear modulus, and bulk modulus, describing the deformation of solids under stress.</p>
            <h4>Hydrostatics and Fluid Dynamics</h4>
            <p>This includes concepts of pressure in fluids, buoyancy, Archimedes' principle, Bernoulli’s equation for fluid flow, principles of incompressible fluid flow, surface tension, adhesion, cohesion, viscosity, capillarity, and properties of drops and bubbles.</p>
            <p>The direct and significant contradiction between the content listed for Unilag PHY 102 in the Physics Department/General University context and the Faculty of Engineering outline is notable. The latter lists topics typically found in a Physics I course (Mechanics, Heat, Properties of Matter). This divergence could arise from several factors: the engineering outline might be an older, outdated version of the syllabus; engineering faculties sometimes tailor general science courses to emphasize specific aspects relevant to their discipline, though a complete overlap with PHY 101 topics for PHY 102 would be unusual for a standard curriculum; or it is plausible that the document compilation mistakenly listed PHY 101 topics under the PHY 102 heading. This highlights the critical importance for students to cross-reference information and consult the most current and specific syllabus provided by their particular department or lecturer. While the general Unilag PHY 102 is clearly focused on Electricity, Magnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics, this discrepancy suggests that specific departmental variations might exist, necessitating direct confirmation to avoid misalignment in study preparation. It also underscores the dynamic nature of university curricula.</p>

        <section id="learning-outcomes" class="content-section">
            <h2>III. Expected Learning Outcomes and Skills Development</h2>
            <p class="italic text-neutral-700">This section outlines the key skills and intellectual capacities PHY 102 aims to develop in students. It emphasizes the cultivation of analytical and critical thinking, alongside structured problem-solving strategies, which are essential for success in physics and other scientific disciplines.</p>

            <h3>Analytical and Critical Thinking Skills</h3>
            <p>A primary objective of PHY 102 is to cultivate students' ability to think critically and apply appropriate physics concepts to qualitatively analyze problems and situations. This emphasis extends beyond mere quantitative calculations, promoting a deeper comprehension of physical phenomena. The course explicitly encourages students to "understand the material, do not just memorize it". This directive points towards an assessment philosophy that values conceptual grasp and the ability to reason through physical scenarios.</p>
            <p>The explicit instruction for students to "Demonstrate the ability to think critically and to use appropriate concepts to analyze qualitatively problems or situations" and to "understand the material, do not just memorize it" indicates a pedagogical shift from mere factual recall to higher-order thinking skills. The emphasis on "qualitative analysis" and "understanding" suggests that assessments will test the application of principles in diverse contexts and the ability to articulate physical reasoning, rather than simply providing formulaic solutions. Students are therefore expected to internalize the 'why' and 'how' behind physical phenomena, not just the 'what'. This prepares them for advanced studies where complex problem-solving requires a deep conceptual foundation and the flexibility to adapt principles to novel situations. It also suggests that examinations will likely feature a significant component of conceptual questions alongside numerical problems.</p>

            <h3>Problem-Solving Strategies in Physics</h3>
            <p>The course strongly emphasizes a structured and systematic problem-solving approach. Students are guided through a clear process: reading the problem carefully to determine the underlying physical principle, listing all given and unknown information, drawing a relevant picture or diagram labeling knowns and unknowns, identifying relationships between variables, and finally, solving for the unknown quantities. Students are strongly encouraged to diligently work through suggested homework problems, even if they are not collected for grading, as this practice is considered "very important for learning the material".</p>
            <p>This structured approach to problem-solving is a form of metacognition, teaching students how to learn and how to approach complex challenges in physics. The emphasis on independent practice, even without direct grading, highlights that the process of engagement and iterative problem-solving is deemed more valuable for learning than simply achieving a correct answer. Success in PHY 102, and indeed, in any rigorous scientific discipline, is directly correlated with consistent, active engagement and the adoption of effective problem-solving heuristics. The course is designed not merely to transmit knowledge but to cultivate analytical habits and resilience in tackling scientific problems, skills that are highly transferable to professional contexts.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Attendance and Homework</h3>
            <p>Attendance is highly emphasized, with a clear expectation for students to attend all lectures. This underscores the value placed on direct instruction and in-class engagement. A penalty of 2% for each absence after three excused absences is specified, indicating the seriousness with which attendance is viewed. Homework assignments are distributed regularly and are "strongly encouraged". While they may not be collected for direct grading, their completion is deemed "very important for learning the material", signifying their role in reinforcing concepts and developing problem-solving proficiency.</p>
            <p>This dual emphasis on physical presence and independent practice reflects a core belief that consistent, active engagement is essential for mastering the complex concepts of physics. Lectures likely introduce intricate ideas and problem-solving techniques that are difficult to grasp through self-study alone, while homework provides the necessary reinforcement and application opportunities. The attendance penalty system signals the university's commitment to a structured and disciplined learning environment. The course structure implicitly communicates that physics is a subject that requires continuous effort and cannot be effectively learned through last-minute cramming. Success hinges on regular exposure to new material, active participation in learning activities, and consistent practice.</p>

            <h3>Laboratory Component</h3>
            <p>Satisfactory performance in laboratory sessions is a required and integral part of this course. This highlights the empirical nature of physics education. For each missed lab, a significant penalty of half a letter grade drop from the final grade is applied, reflecting departmental policy. An opportunity to make up one lab is provided at the end of the semester. Labs contribute 10% of the final grade, indicating their direct impact on overall academic performance.</p>
            <p>Physics is fundamentally an experimental science. The laboratory component is not a supplementary activity but a critical element that allows students to observe theoretical concepts in action, develop practical experimental skills—such as data collection, analysis, and error estimation—and understand the empirical basis of physical laws. This hands-on experience bridges the gap between abstract equations and real-world phenomena. The strict penalty system underscores the critical importance of this experiential learning. The lab component is crucial for developing practical scientific competencies, reinforcing theoretical knowledge, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the experimental foundation of physics. It ensures students gain skills beyond theoretical problem-solving, which is vital for any scientific or engineering career that requires practical application and validation of principles.</p>

            <h3>Quizzes and Examinations</h3>
            <p>The assessment structure includes seven 30-minute quizzes administered throughout the semester, culminating in a comprehensive final exam. This frequent assessment model encourages continuous study. Quizzes typically consist of a mixture of multiple-choice questions, definitions, conceptual questions, and selected problems similar to those covered in class or from the suggested problem list. This diverse format tests various levels of understanding. All quizzes and the final exam are closed book, and no formulae are provided. This policy strongly emphasizes the student's conceptual grasp and ability to recall and apply principles independently, rather than relying on memorization of formulas. Graphing calculators are explicitly not permitted for exams, further reinforcing the focus on fundamental understanding and analytical skills over computational aids. The final exam is cumulative, covering all twelve chapters of the course material, ensuring a holistic evaluation of learning across the entire semester.</p>
            <p>This rigorous assessment design reveals a pedagogical philosophy that values deep conceptual understanding and genuine problem-solving ability over superficial memorization or reliance on external tools. Frequent quizzes encourage consistent study habits and deter last-minute cramming. The cumulative final ensures long-term retention and the ability to connect disparate topics. The "no formulas provided" rule demands that students internalize the derivations and applications of physical laws. The assessment strategy is designed to rigorously test a student's fundamental comprehension and analytical reasoning. It pushes students to internalize the material, understand the interrelationships between different concepts, and develop strong analytical reasoning without computational shortcuts. This prepares them not just for the next physics course but for real-world scientific and engineering challenges where fundamental understanding and critical thinking are paramount.</p>

        <section id="resources" class="content-section">
            <h2>V. Recommended Resources and Study Strategies</h2>
            <p class="italic text-neutral-700">This section discusses the types of textbooks and supplementary materials that align with the PHY 102 syllabus. It also outlines effective study approaches recommended for mastering the course content, emphasizing proactive learning and consistent practice.</p>

            <h3>Textbooks and Supplementary Materials</h3>
            <p>While a specific Unilag-mandated textbook is not explicitly detailed in the primary Unilag sources, general "Physics II" courses at other universities often recommend comprehensive texts such as "College Physics: A Strategic Approach" by Knight, Jones, and Field or "College Physics" by Raymond A. Serway and Chris Vuille. These textbooks typically provide extensive coverage of Electricity, Magnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics, aligning well with the core topics identified for Unilag's PHY 102 syllabus. They usually include detailed explanations, worked examples, and a wide array of practice problems.</p>
            <p>These recommended textbooks are foundational in introductory physics curricula globally. Their widespread adoption indicates that they effectively cover the breadth and depth of topics expected in such a course, providing a structured learning path with ample examples and practice. Students should seek out a reputable, algebra-based introductory physics textbook that comprehensively covers the identified core topics (Electricity, Magnetism, Optics, Modern Physics). Such a textbook will serve as the primary self-study resource, complementing lectures and providing the necessary practice problems to solidify understanding. The consistency of topics across these general textbooks reinforces the standard, comprehensive nature of the PHY 102 curriculum.</p>

            <h3>Effective Study Approaches for Physics</h3>
            <p>Students are advised to adopt a proactive and iterative learning cycle: reading relevant text material *before* attending lectures to prepare for the content, actively participating in class and taking comprehensive notes, and then diligently rereading the topic carefully after the lecture. This post-lecture review should focus on identifying underlying principles and clearly defining all new terms. The emphasis is explicitly placed on deep understanding rather than mere memorization of facts or formulas. Consistent and diligent practice of suggested problems is highlighted as crucial for effective learning and mastery of the course material.</p>
            <p>The recommended study strategy outlines a clear, multi-stage process: pre-reading, lecture attendance and note-taking, post-lecture review for understanding, and problem-solving practice. This is a highly active and iterative learning cycle, designed to promote deep processing of information. Pre-reading primes the brain, making lectures more effective. Rereading and principle identification after the lecture consolidate understanding. Problem-solving then serves as the ultimate test of comprehension and application, moving knowledge from passive recall to active use. The university implicitly guides students towards effective metacognitive strategies crucial for mastering complex subjects. Success in PHY 102 is not solely dependent on innate ability but significantly on adopting a disciplined, multi-stage learning process that emphasizes conceptual mastery and active application. This approach is highly transferable to many other rigorous academic and professional disciplines.</p>
